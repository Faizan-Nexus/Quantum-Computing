# Projects

This folder is reserved for larger **quantum computing projects and implementations**.  
It contains applied work that builds on the concepts practiced in the **Learning Exercises** section.

---

## Purpose
- Apply Qiskit knowledge to more complete quantum algorithms.  
- Explore real-world inspired use cases of quantum computing.  
- Document progress from small experiments to structured projects.  

---

## Current Project
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**  
  Implementation and exploration of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm using Qiskit.  
  Includes circuit construction, simulation, and analysis of results.

---

## Notes
- This folder will continue to grow as more projects are completed.  
- Each new project will include its own README to describe goals, methods, and results.  
- Future projects may include algorithms such as Grover’s search and Qunatum Machine Learning Algorithams.  
- For now, only the **Quantum Fourier Transform** project has been added.
