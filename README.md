# Quantum Computing Learning

This repository contains my curated **Quantum Computing experiments and projects** using Qiskit.  
All code is written for **learning and exploration purposes**, with an emphasis on understanding fundamental concepts and building practical skills.

## Folder Structure

- **Learning-Exercises/** – Step-by-step practice exercises, small challenges, and solutions to strengthen quantum computing fundamentals.
  - **Basics/** – Introductory Qiskit programs (quantum circuits, statevectors, measurements).
  - **Gate Experiments/** – Hands-on exploration of quantum gates and their properties.
  - **Challenges/** – Problem-solving exercises to apply and test concepts.
- **Projects/** – More polished, structured projects demonstrating applied concepts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Build a strong foundation in qubits, gates, and quantum circuits.  
- Gain hands-on experience with Qiskit simulation and experimentation.  
- Explore quantum algorithms and their applications in classical and quantum machine learning.  
- Demonstrate disciplined learning and problem-solving through structured exercises and projects.

## Notes

- All code files in this repository are written for **Qiskit programming practice**.  
- The repository supports Qiskit versions **updated until July 2025**.  
- Some files may require newer versions of Qiskit to run correctly.  
- Certain simulations may or may not work depending on the installed Qiskit version and available simulators.  
- This repository reflects a **learning journey**—from basic experiments to applied projects. While code is not production-level, it shows curiosity, growth, and a solid grasp of fundamentals.
