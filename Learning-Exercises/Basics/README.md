# Basics

This folder contains introductory Qiskit programs to build a foundation in quantum computing.

## Contents
- Creating simple quantum circuits
- Applying basic gates (`X`, `H`, `CX`)
- Measuring qubits
- Simulating and visualizing statevectors

## Goal
To understand the fundamentals of quantum circuits and how Qiskit represents quantum states.
