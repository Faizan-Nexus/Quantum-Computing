# Gate Experiments

This folder explores the behavior of different quantum gates and their effects on qubits.

## Contents
- Single-qubit gates (Pauli-X, Y, Z, Hadamard)
- Multi-qubit gates (CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli)
- Visualizing transformations on Bloch spheres
- Comparing classical vs quantum logic

## Goal
To gain intuition about how quantum gates manipulate qubits and create superposition/entanglement.
